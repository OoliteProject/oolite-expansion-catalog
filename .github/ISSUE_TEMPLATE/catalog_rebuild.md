        A rebuild of the catalog involves downloading all expansions, extracting their manifests and assembling them into one catalog file.
        This file will then made available for expansion managers. On top of that the HTML index will be updated.

        Please be aware such rebuilds are done upon catalog changes and in regular intervals. There should be reason why an additional rebuild
        seems necessary.
